		<h1><center>2018 NBA Draft Top 10 Selections Graded</center></h1>

		<br>
		<br>

		<h2>1. Deandre Ayton to Phoenix Suns</h2>
		<br>
		<img src="https://uproxx.files.wordpress.com/2018/07/deandre-ayton-shoes.jpg?quality=95&w=650" alt="Ayton" width="260" height="200">
		<br>
		<div><p>There was no doubt going in to the draft that Ayton would be selected by the Suns at number 1, and, as expected, Ayton was chosen first. The Suns will have a very bright future should Ayton's remarkable offensive skillset translate into the NBA. The offensive duo of Ayton and Booker will be an unstoppable force in the Western Conference in years to come. Ayton proved his ability to make shots from outside, as he was a servicable mid range shooter in college that forced his defender to stay tight with Ayton when inside the three point line. Ayton is also extremely athletic and dominated other centers in the paint with his 7 foot 5 inch wingspan.</p>

		

		<div><p>Ayton also boasted a 34.3% 3 point percentage in college, showing that there is potential for him to grow into a consistent three point shooter in the NBA. The 7 foot 1 inch center proved himself as the most durable player in the draft, starting all 35 of the Arizona Wildcats games and playing 33.5 minutes per game. Ayton's averages of 14.5 points and 10.5 rebounds per game in the Summer League are promising, as he showcased his skills against other rookies. If Ayton can just improve his defense slightly, he could well be the greatest center in the NBA.</p></div>

		

		<h3>Grade: A</h3>

		<br>

		<h2>2. Marvin Bagley III to Sacramento Kings</h2>

		<br>

		<img src="https://www.nba.com/kings/sites/kings/files/styles/hi_res_full_width/public/bagleyupdate-lrg.jpg?itok=5lumdoHv" alt="Bagley" width="260" height="200">

		<br>

		<div><p>It has become increasingly apparent in recent times that Sacramento seems to be unable to pick a star player, or even a borderline all star, with any of their abundance of lottery picks. Their selection last year, De'aarron Fox, has great potential but will definetly need some help in order to make the Kings title contenders.</p>

		<p>Insert Marvin Bagley III</p>

		<p>Offensively, Bagley proved his worth in college, by averaging 21 PPG, whilst shooting 61.4% from the field and 39.7% from 3. These statistics are outstanding and if Bagley is able to score with similar efficiency at the NBA level, he will be able to be the offensive juggernaut on a contending team. He has the size to be effective in the post and in the paint and the range to score from beyond the three point line at a consistent rate</p>

		<p>However, there are some question marks about his game that could be stop him from being a star in the NBA. Firstly, he was an inconsistent defender in college. His defense must improve in the NBA as he will get abused by other NBA big men who are more experienced and know how to take advantage of weaker defenders. Secondly, his performance in the NBA summer league was very dissapointing. He averaged 10 points and 5.75 rebounds on awful efficiency, by shooting 10% from three and 33% from the field. Nonetheless, if Bagley can improve his defense and the Summer League was just an anomaly, then Sacramento's decision to draft Bagley will end up being a risk that was worth taking.</p></div>

		<h3>Grade: B+</h3>

		<br>

		<h2>3. Luka Doncic to Dallas Mavericks</h2>

		<br>

		<img src="https://mavs-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/GettyImages-980903452_master-001-826x620.jpg" alt="Doncic" width="260" height="200">

		<br>

		<div><p>Luka Doncic is arguably both the most NBA ready player in the draft and the most exciting European prospect in the history of the NBA. Doncic is 6 foot 8 and can play anywhere from point guard to small forward. He is an exquisite passer and has the ability to control the offense flawlessly, a skill that cannot be taught and very rare amongst rookies. Doncic also has a step back similar to that of James Harden, allowing him to create seperation on the offensive end despite having average athleticism. Both his three point and mid range shots are smooth and are often very effective. Doncic has also already proved himself as a player who lives for the big moments, stepping up several times in the clutch in the Euroleague, the second greteast basketball league in the world.</p>

		<p>There are some concerns, such as inconsistent defence and the before mentioned average athleticism, but the positives should outweigh the negatives. If things go right, the back court of Dennis Smith Jr and Luka Doncic could be a title winning duo in Dallas.</p>

		<p>The Mavericks may have just hit the jackpot</p></div>

		<h3>Grade: A+</h3>

		<br>

		<h2>4. Jaren Jackson Jr to Memphis Grizzlies</h2>

		<br>

		<img src="https://s21482.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/nba-summer-league-jaren-jackson-jr-moritz-wagner-standing-out-1920x1440.jpg" alt="Jackson" width="260" height="200">

		<br>

		<div><p>Looking at Jackson's college stats alone, this pick may seem like a waste considering some of the other prospects that were still on the board. However, his 10.9 points and 5.8 rebounds per game do not tell the whole story</p>

		<p>Jackson Jr is undoubtedly one of the best defenders in the draft as he averaged 3 blocks per game in just 22 minutes in college. He should be able to defend some of the NBA best big men with his physicality, defensive awareness and pure defensive talent. Furthermore, Jackson is an underappreciated offensive player. He shot just under 40% percent from three on 2.7 attempts per game, he is a force in the low post as he shoots very efficiently in the post, he dribbles and handles the ball like a small forward. Furthermore, he will have the perfect mentor in Memphis in Marc Gasol, who will teach Jackson a few tricks on both ends of the court.</p></div>

		<h3>Grade: B+</h3>

		<br>

		<h2>5. Trae Young to Atlanta Hawks</h2>

		<br>

		<img src="https://www.nba.com/hawks/sites/hawks/files/styles/story_main_photo/public/garrett_ellwood3_0.jpg?itok=_eMOis7v" alt="Young" width="260" height="200">

		<br>

		<div><p>Out of all of this year lottery picks, this one was by far and away the most risky. The largely popular opinion amongst NBA fans is that Young could be the new Stephen Curry or the new Jimmer Fredette. Although he will most likely never reach the heights of Curry, there is no doubt that Young has the potential to become a superstar in this league. He averaged 27.4 points and 8.7 assists in college and continued this in the Summer League by averaging 17 points and 6.8 assists. Young is a world class shooter of the basketball and has the ability to go off for massive scoring nights whilst also being a brilliant passer of the ball.</p>

		<p>Unfortunately, Young has the most bust potential in the lottery, as he is a very inefficient shooter. In his first two Summer League games he shot 9-36 from the field and 2-16 from three and in college he shot just 42% from the field. Young is also an atrocious defender, who will get exposed by other guards in the NBA if he does not improve. Only time will tell if Trae Young will be a star or a bust.</p></div>

		<h3>Grade: C+</h3>

		<br>

		<h2>6. Mohamed Bamba to Orlando Magic</h2>

		<br>

		<img src="https://www.nba.com/magic/sites/magic/files/styles/story_main_photo/public/bamba00_760_20180709.jpg?itok=1ZZoeXze" alt="Bamba" width="260" height="200">

		<br>

		<div><p>Similar to the Sacramento Kings, the Orlando Magic have not exactly been the most successful of NBA teams in recent NBA Drafts. The Magic have drafted Victor Oladipo, Dario Saric and Domantas Sabonis, all of which are not on the Magic and have all turned in great players, and in Oladipo's case, a superstar. They also have drafted Mario Hezonja and Jonathan Isaac who have been dissapointing ever since joining the league. However, their luck may have just turned around.</p>

		<p>Mohamed Bamba is 7 foot 1 center out of Texas who was more than proven himself as worthy of the 6th pick. Bamba has an unfathomable 7 foot 10 inch wingspan, which helped him average 4.9 blocks per 40 minutes in collge. Not only is Bamba a fantastic defensive prospect, but he also is effective on the opposite end of the court. He averaged 12.9 points on 54.1 percent shooting and also showed his ability to knock down threes every once in a while. Along with Aaron Gordon and a potentially improved Jonhathan Isaac, this Magic side could make some noise in the East</p></div>

		<h3>Grade: A</h3>

		<br>

		<h2>7. Wendell Carter Jr to Chicago Bulls</h2>

		<br>

		<img src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/nXPEeT78xowIT8JdCdJAkVSzrUg=/0x0:3000x2051/920x613/filters:focal(1187x0:1667x480):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/60348425/GettyImages_995680642.0.jpg" alt="Carter" width="260" height="200">

		<br>

		<div><p>Looking at the current Chicago Bulls roster, picking Wendell Carter Jr at 7 was a smart move. Wendell is a very well rounded big man who was no clear weaknesses in his game. Carter is very quick on both ends of the court, which will be very important for their spacing on the offensive end and their structure defensively. Offensively, Carter can space the floor and hit mid range jumpers whilts also being able to score in the paint. Defensively, Carter can guard the paint and also switch onto other postions.</p>

		<p>Furthermore, Wendell is a great rebounder as he averaged 9 per game in college and he shot very efficiently at 56% from the field and 41% from three. He was also named to the All Summer League first team after averaging 14.6 points and 9.4 rebounds. Carter looks to be a very valuable NBA player.</p></div>

		<h3>Grade: A-</h3>

		<br>

		<h2>8. Collin Sexton to Cleveland Cavaliers</h2>

		<br>

		<img src="http://a.espncdn.com/media/motion/2018/0715/dm_180715_NBA_Cavaliers_Sexton_SOTFULL/dm_180715_NBA_Cavaliers_Sexton_SOTFULL.jpg" alt="Sexton" width="260" height="200">

		<br>

		<div><p>With the drafting of Collin Sexton came the post Lebron era in Cleveland as just 2 and a half weeks after Sexton was drafted, Lebron officially signed with the Los Angeles Lakers. Although Sexton has arguably the second largest shoes in NBA history to fill and is unlikely to ever surpass the achievements of Lebron, the 19 year old point guard has a bright future ahead of him.</p>

		<p>Sexton is a machine on both ends of the court, as he is an aggresive who scorer who loves drive into the paint and is also a very solid defensive player. Two way superstars at the guard position are few and far between but Sexton could potentially ignite this trend in the NBA if his play turns out to be effective.</p>

		<p>However, in order to reach these heights Sexton must improve his three point and mid range shots and must become a better passer, as these are skills that most great guards have. Anyway, this is a solid pick up by the Cavs.</p></div>

		<h3>Grade: A-</h3>

		<br>

		<h2>9. Kevin Knox to New York Knicks</h2>

		<br>

		<img src="https://www.metro.us/sites/default/files/styles/normal_article/public/main/articles/sptn_knox_0712.gif" alt="Knox" width="260" height="200">

		<br>

		<div><p>It was very evident that when Adam Silver prepared to read out the Knicks' selection, the New York fans in the crowd were pleading for Michael Porter Jr. Instead, the Knicks chose Kevin Knox, who has less potential than Porter but is most definitely the safer option. Knox perfromed very well in the Summer league by averaging just over 21 points and he will also have many offensive opportunites next year due to the injury of Kristaps Porzingis.</p>

		<p>Despite this, Knox will need to make some major improvements if he wants to be one of the league's best three-and-D players, as he is inconsistent on defense as he  often swithches off and he only shot 34% from three in college</p></div>

		<h3>Grade: B+</h3>

		<br>

		<h2>10. Mikal Bridges to Phoenix Suns</h2>

		<br>

		<img src="https://imagesvc.timeincapp.com/v3/fan/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fvalleyofthesuns.com%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fgetty-images%2F2017%2F07%2F982428348.jpeg&c=sc&w=850&h=560" alt="Bridges" height="200" width="260">

		<div><p>The question marks that have been put on Kevin Knox on his ability to be a solid three-and-D player are non existent when it comes to Mikal Bridges. Bridges is a remarkable defensive player that will help the suns massively considering that they had the worst defense in the league last year. Bridges was the best player on the NCAA Championship winning Vilanova team as he averaged 17.7 points on 51.4% from the field and an incredible 43.5% from three.</p>

		<p>There are no major negatives about Bridges, as he can do it all on both ends of the court. He will help the Suns immediately due to his experience and his selfless play style. This would have been an A+ had the Suns not given up the Heat's 2021 1st rounder to get him.</p></div>

		<h3>Grade: A</h3>
