		<h1><center>5 Winners of the 2018 NBA Off Season</center></h1>

		<br>


		<h3>Despite the fact the off season has still not concluded and there is still room for more suprises, trades and signings, we have decided on 5 NBA teams who have improved their state in the league over the summer.</h3>

		<br>

		<h2><center>Los Angeles Lakers</center></h2>

		<br>

		<br>

		<h3>Lebron James has now joined the illustrious and what seems like the never ending list of superstars that have played for the Lakers. Wilt, West, Kareem, Magic, Shaq and Kobe all won at least one ring each for the Lakers. It is Lebron goal to join that group. The Lakers also brought in Rajon Rondo, Lance Stephenson and Javale Mcgee, who will also be servicable role players for the team. If you think it cannot get any better, you're wrong, as the Lakers have several players on one year deals which clear up enough cap space to potentially sign Kahwi Leonard next summer. The Lakers are back in business.</h3>

		<center><h3>Grade: A</h3></center>

		<br>

		<h2><center>Golden State Warriors</center></h2>

		<br>

		<br>

		<h3>Last year, we saw the greatest team in NBA history roll through the regular season and playoffs, sweeping the Cleveland Cavaliers in the finals to raise the NBA Championship for the second straight year. That team was the Golden State Warriors, a team with 4 all stars and a strong supporting cast. That same team just signed Demarcus Cousins, who was the best center in the league before getting injured just before the all star break. The Warriors have essentialy already wrapped up the three peat. </h3>

		<center><h3>Grade: A+</h3></center>

		<br>

		<h2><center>Oklahoma City Thunder</center></h2>

		<br>

		<center><img src="https://www.clnsmedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/george-westbrook-celebrate-2-640x513.jpg" alt="thunder" width="260" height="200"></center>

		<br>

		<h3>This off season was crucial for the Thunder as Paul George's contract was up and if they lost him, they would probably lose Westbrook as well. Not only were the Thunder able to resign George long term, but they were also able to trade away Carmelo Anthony's horrible contract, and recieved Dennis Schroder, a high quality NBA point guard who could start with Russell Westbrook or could come of the bench and provide a much needed scoring punch. Oklahoma have ticked all of their off season boxes.</h3>

		<center><h3>Grade: A-</h3></center>

		<br>

		<h2><center>Indiana Pacers</center></h2>

		<br>

		<center><img src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/UtNu2dgv2bofF6nCNwDy97-mwGM=/0x0:3279x2184/1200x675/filters:focal(1474x339:1998x863)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/59396903/usa_today_10734862.0.jpg" alt="pacers" width="260" height="200"></center>

		<br>

		<h3>Unlike some of the other teams on this list, the Pacers did not make a massive signing or trade, but the moves that they did make more than hold their own and will help Indiana massively. They signed Tyreke Evans to $12 million dollar deal which is a great price considering his output last year, and they were able to acquire Kyle O'Quinn, an energetic center who is an upgrade over Al Jefferson and Doug Mcdermott, a reliable shooter. However the loss of Lance Stephenson could hurt them. Regardless, this off season was a strong showing for the Pacers, who will hope to contend in the East with abscence of Lebron James.</h3>

		<center><h3>Grade: A-</h3></center>

		<br>

		<h2><center>Toronto Raptors</center></h2>

		<br>

		<center><img src="https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_scale,w_912,h_516,c_fill,g_auto/shape/cover/sport/toronto-raptors-v-san-antonio-spurs-5b478efb42fc33358a000059.jpg" alt="raptors" width="260" height="200"></center>

		<br>

		<h3>Yes, the two players in the picture above have switched teams in a blockbuster trade that shocked the world, Most people believe that this was a horrible move for Toronto, but we see otherwise.</h3>

		<h3>Firstly, Toronto needed a new direction, and this trade will tell them whether to rebuild or contend by next summer. If Kawhi resigns with the team, they will go ahea and contend. If Kawhi signs elsewhere, they can start a rebuild. The Raptors had no future with Derozan, they would never beat the Celtics. This move is a risk, but even if Kahwi leaves, at least they were willing to change.</h3>

		<center><h3>Grade: B+</h3></center>
